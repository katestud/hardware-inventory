# Hardware Inventory

A place to collect an inventory of all the various hardware pieces I have.
Ideally so I don't forget and so I have easy links to documentation when I want
to revisit any of them. Also links to projects I've done with them, maybe?

## Devices

- [Badger 2350](https://github.com/badger/home) - A programmable badge with an e-ink
display, which was created for GitHub Universe 2024. I didn't get to attend, but
I was able to buy one from the GitHub Store afterwards.
